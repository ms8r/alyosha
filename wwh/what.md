What is Thify?
==============

Think of Thify as a "counter recommendation engine" for news feeds and editorial content on the web.

There is an increasingly vibrant discussion about how the filtering algorithms behind news feeds help increasing polarization in a society. As a recent [comment](http://mathbabe.org/2014/06/30/thanks-for-a-great-case-study-facebook/#comments) on [mathbabe.org](http://mathbabe.org) put it:

> There was a time when there were only three major news sources available to
> people on a daily basis and the news they provided was governed by a
> fairness doctrine. The segmentation that began with cable TV has
> increased with the internet... This segmentation leads to a situation
> where oneâ€™s world view is constantly reinforced making it harder for
> open-mindedness to prevail.

Thify tries to go against this trend of self-reinforcing world views. Given the URL of a news article, an editorial or a blog post on some subject, Thify will suggest additional articles on the same subject from sources *across the opinion spectrum*. It will show you content that you normally wouldn't see or look at, but that's at least substantial and relevant enough to have a debate about. Kind of *"If you like this you'll probably won't like this but it's still worth reading"*. For more background on Thify please look at the [Why?](/thify-why) section.

Want to try it? It's dead simple: Say you read an article in whatever your favorite news or editorial source is, and you ask yourself if there is more to that story than meets the eye. Simply take the article's URL and paste it into the entry field on the [Thify home page](/). Then hit the "I'll take it straight" button and Thify will crank away, analyzing the article at your URL and searching for content on the same subject from a hole range of sources. The result is presented as a spread across the traditional "left to right" political spectrum, with the best content matches ranking at the top. You'd be surprised how much simply filling in some factual gaps can broaden or shift your view on a subject.
