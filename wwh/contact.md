Contact Thify
=============

Drop me a line at `ms [at] thify.org`. 

At this point Thify is something like a first draft of an idea. If you think it could be turned into something useful let me know any ideas, comments, thoughts. 

If you like the idea enough to want to contribute - great. Especially if you have some experience in Web design and programming, specifically CSS, and JavaScript (my own experience in that domain is mnimal and only acquired on an "as needed basis" for this project). Of course the backend (Python) can also always use a helping hand... Have a look [here](thify-how#thify-how-technology) to see what building blocks Thify uses. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ms8r/alyosha).
