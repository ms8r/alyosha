Thanks!

Thify is decicated to Alyosha whom - among many other things - I admired for having distictly differnt political views than the people around him while remaining a very close friend to all of them.

Thanks to Gary - you may remember an after-dinner discussion at your house that triggered the original idea for Thify.

Thanks to Arthur for a lot of encouragement - of course the result now may be very different from what you had in mind when you were enthusiastic about the idea... Thanks also for getting me hooked on Habermas and for keeping up the pace up those hills ;-) 

Thanks to  Mike for thinking "outside the box" and for being a great living example that "one dimensional" simply doesn't cut it!

On the "[nuts-and-bolts](/thify-how#thify-how-technology)" side, Thify stands on the proverbial "shoulders of giants" (where it - maybe -  shows as a tiny blib, hopefully pointing upwards...): Perhaps most notably [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) for [web.py](http://webpy.org/) and his contribution to [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (in which these static content pages are maintained). Judging by his work, he must have been an exceptionally brilliant mind, tragicaly driven to suicide at the age of 26 by a heavy handed federal prosecution that appears to have had lost all proportion to the alleged offense. [Xavier Grangier](https://github.com/grangier)'s Python version of [Goose](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/goose-extractor/) is indispensable as are [NLTK](www.nltk.org)'s [lemmatizers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation), [stemmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming), and [part-of-speech taggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging). [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/about/) claims that his [RQ](http://python-rq.org/) "is designed to have a low barrier to entry" and he's right: "Easy job queues for Python" - just as advertised!
