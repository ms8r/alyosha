Alyosha - A counter recommendation engine for news feeds
========================================================

*Note: This project is its very early stages...*

There has been some discussion in the media on the filtering algorithms behind news feeds increasing polarization in a society. As a recent blog comment put it [here](http://mathbabe.org/2014/06/30/thanks-for-a-great-case-study-facebook/#comments): 

> There was a time when there were only three major news sources available to
> people on a daily basis and the news they provided was governed by a
> fairness doctrine. The segmentation that began with cable TV has
> increased with the internet... This segmentation leads to a situation
> where one’s world view is constantly reinforced making it harder for
> open-mindedness to prevail.

The idea behind Alyosha is - on any given subject - to provide you with an recommendation to a news article or editorial piece that you normally wouldn't see or look at, but that's at least substantial and relevant enough to have a debate about. Kind of *"If you like this you'll probably won't like this but it's still worth reading"*.

The idea was partially inspired by [Philip Tetlock's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_E._Tetlock) study on the accuracy of experts' predictions, distinguishing between *foxes* and *hedgehogs* (the following quote taken from [The Long Now](http://longnow.org/seminars/02007/jan/26/why-foxes-are-better-forecasters-than-hedgehogs/)):

> The ancient Greek warrior poet Archilochus coined the phrase: “The fox knows
> many things; the hedgehog one great thing.” The idea was later expanded by
> essayist Isaiah Berlin. In Tetlock’s interpretation, Hedgehogs have one grand
> theory (Marxist, Libertarian, whatever) which they are happy to extend into
> many domains, relishing its parsimony, and expressing their views with great
> confidence. Foxes, on the other hand are skeptical about grand theories,
> diffident in their forecasts, and ready to adjust their ideas based on actual
> events.
> ...
> Hedgehogs annoy only their political opposition, while Foxes annoy across the
> political spectrum, in part because the smartest Foxes cherry-pick idea
> fragments from the whole array of Hedgehogs.
